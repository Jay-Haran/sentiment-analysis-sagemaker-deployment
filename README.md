This project covers the implementation and deployment of a model which interacts with a simple frontend website, responding live to whether a user submitted movie review is positive or negative. The model implemented was an RNN architecture implemented using PyTorch and trained on the IMDB dataset. The model was deployed using Amazon Sagemaker and the aim of completing this project was to gain familiarity with the entire lifecyle of a machine learning project.
