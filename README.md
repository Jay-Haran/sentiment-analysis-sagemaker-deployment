# sentiment-analysis-sagemaker-deployment
I deployed a model using Amazon SageMaker to complete the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project. The goal 
was to implement a neural network architecture utilising Pytorch trained on the IMDB Dataset which interacted with a simple front 
end website to return live predictions. In the website the user can enter a movie review and the model would return a prediction
of either a positive or negative review.
